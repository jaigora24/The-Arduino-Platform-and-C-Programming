Write a program that causes the built-in LED connected to pin 13 on the Arduino to blink, alternating between fast blinks and slow blinks. The LED should blink
5 times quickly and then it should blink 5 more times slowly. When blinking quickly, the LED should have a 1 secondperiod, so it should be high for 0.5 seconds
and low for 0.5 seconds. When blinking slowly, the LED should have a 4 second period, so it should be high for 2 seconds and low for 2 seconds. The LED should
continue to blink in this alternating fashion for as long as the Arduino receives power. Make sure your program compiles. Then, save a text version of your
program and upload it here. Do not upload the executable file.

void setup(void)
pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
void loop(void)
{
    for(int i = 0; i < 5;i++ )
    {
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN , HIGH);     //turn LED on by making the voltage high
        delay(500);                           //wait a half second
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN , LOW);      //turn LED off by making the volatge low
        delay(500);                           //wait a half second
    }
    {
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN , HIGH);     //turn LED on by making the voltage high
        delay(2000);                          //wait a half second
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN , LOW);      //turn LED on by making the voltage low
        delay(2000);                          //wait a half second
    }
