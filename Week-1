Install the Arduino IDE on your computer. Compile the "Blink" example, upload the example to the Arduino board, and make sure that the LED blinks.
Use the www.tinkercad.comâ€‹ simulator if you do not have the Arduino hardware. Take and upload a screen shot that shows the "Done compiling"
message and the byte number information in the message area.
